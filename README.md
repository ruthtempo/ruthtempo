<h1 align="center">Hi, it's Ruth !</h1>

* Made in Barcelona
* Living in :round_pushpin: Germany
* On summer 2021 I commited to become a Web Developer and slowly :snail:  but steadily :muscle: I'm getting closer to that goal everyday. 
* After finishing a 350h bootcamp with focus on VueJS, I wanted to check out other frameworks and that's when I fell for the combo ReactJS + Typescript.
* I am very lucky :pray: to have an experienced Sofware Engineer [/kruschid](https://github.com/kruschid) as my mentor, turning my learning process into something very enriching.
